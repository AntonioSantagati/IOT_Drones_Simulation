#  Distributed End-to-End UAV Simulation with PX4, ROS 2, and RobotKube

This repository contains the implementation of a **distributed simulation framework** for UAV systems, integrating **PX4 SITL**, **ROS 2**, and **RobotKube** within a **K3d** Kubernetes cluster.  
The goal is to demonstrate how **event-driven orchestration** can dynamically manage application modules in response to real-time UAV telemetry.

---

## Overview

The system simulates multiple UAVs in a distributed environment, allowing **automatic deployment** of applications (e.g., data recording) based on the state of the simulation.  
When certain events occur‚Äîsuch as two drones flying within a specified distance‚ÄîRobotKube dynamically triggers or stops modules according to defined rules.

### Key Features
- **PX4 SITL** for UAV simulation  
- **ROS 2** as communication middleware (DDS-based)  
- **RobotKube** for event-driven orchestration in Kubernetes  
- **MongoDB** for persistent UAV data storage  
- **QGroundControl** as ground control station  
- Fully containerized setup using **Docker** and **K3d**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed:

| Tool | Version | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) | ‚â• 24.0 | Container runtime |
| [K3d](https://k3d.io/) | ‚â• 5.6 | Lightweight Kubernetes cluster in Docker |
| [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) | ‚â• 1.28 | Kubernetes CLI |
| [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) | Recommended | Middleware for robotics |
| [PX4 Autopilot](https://px4.io/) | ‚â• 1.14 | UAV autopilot software |
| [QGroundControl](https://qgroundcontrol.com/) | latest | Ground Control Station GUI |
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) | ‚â• 6.0 | Database for UAV data |

## üß† How It Works

1. **PX4 SITL** simulates UAVs and publishes telemetry via **MAVLink**.  
2. **Micro XRCE-DDS Agent** bridges MAVLink messages to ROS 2 topics.  
3. The **Event Detector** node monitors telemetry and detects conditions (e.g., distance < 50 m).  
4. Upon detection, it triggers **RobotKube**, which dynamically deploys or removes applications (e.g., a Data Recorder) inside the **K3d cluster**.  
5. The **Data Recorder** writes the UAV data into **MongoDB**.  
6. **QGroundControl** allows visualization and manual mission control.
